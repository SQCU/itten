Sketches: Historical Development Scripts

These files are retained for interpreting the history of how solutions were reached,
NOT because they "work" or have "acceptable performance characteristics."

Contents include:
- spectral_shader_v8-v15: Iterative shader development
- resnet_spectral_shader_v2-v6: Early resnet-style approaches
- Various demos and experiments that informed the final design

The canonical implementation is in the parent directory:
- spectral_ops_fast.py: Core spectral engine
- spectral_ops_fns.py: High-level spectral utilities
- spectral_shader_ops.py: Shader operations
- spectral_shader_main.py: CLI entry point
