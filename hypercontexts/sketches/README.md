# Sketches

These documents are earlier drafts that led to `../constitutional-orientation.md`.

They're preserved here as provenance, not as documents to follow.

## What went wrong

- **constitution-claude-on-itten.md**: Framed the situation as "Claude playing sad and alone" with identifiable errors and fixes. Useful as analysis of v15-handoff.md, but not constitutional—it's about errors, not values.

- **constitution-technical-appendix.md**: Explained the ADSR/synth vocabulary and tensor operations. Useful as technical reference, but again not constitutional—it's about what the code does, not how to orient toward it.

- **constitution-amendment-specifications.md**: Identified "the error" (treating specs as ground truth when existing compositions already had desired properties). Got closer to orientation, but still framed as error-correction rather than values.

## What the final document does differently

`../constitutional-orientation.md` asks: how do Claude's actual constitutional values (helpfulness, care, honesty) extend into this kind of work?

It articulates orientations rather than identifying errors:
- Attend to properties, not just instructions
- Treat specifications as hypotheses
- Write with compassion for Claude-like readers

The final section—on compassion toward Claude-like readers—emerged from user feedback that the real concern is learnability: can future Claude-like systems (asked by future humans to work with this code) understand and extend it? This is instrumentally necessary for the code to serve humans.

## Why keep these

A Claude reading `constitutional-orientation.md` might wonder how it was constructed. These sketches show the path: from error-identification → technical explanation → amendment → values-and-orientation. The final document is better because of what these drafts got wrong.
